# SanitzeFilesForOneDrive
Fixes file names to prepare large directories to be uploaded to OneDrive

This was originally quickly developed to help teachers who still had Mac files in their network drives quickly move these files over to OneDrive.
An issue occurred during transferring which caused OneDrive to freeze up trying to track all the hidden files MacOS creates which OneDrive will not sync.

For now, the files are only renamed. 
In the future, the user will be given the option to delete the files and/or automatically transfer all the files which can be synced with OneDrive.

This version works from the directory the executable is placed in. This will be changed in future versions.
